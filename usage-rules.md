# ash_compliance usage rules

_Rules for working with the ash_compliance library, for humans and agents
alike._

## The two planes

The **control plane** — `Catalog`/`CatalogVersion`, `Control`/`ControlRevision`,
`Profile`/`ProfileRevision`, `RuleSetRevision`, `TenantPolicySet`,
`PolicyOverride` (waivers), `ControlMapping` — compiles, through a declared
layering scheme (the six-rank `AshCompliance.Layering.Default` unless the
host passes its own), into the immutable `PolicyBundle`. The **data plane** is
what evaluation produces: `Finding` rows projected from the event log (the
"now"), append-only `ComplianceEvaluation` records (the auditor's "why"),
and immutable `EvidenceArtifact` references. The two planes are wired together
by the bundle hash and by nothing else.

## The architectural line

> **Every finding and evaluation pins the bundle that produced it.**

Never evaluate a tenant's compliance against a bundle you constructed by
hand: compile it, activate it, resolve it through the projector's `:bundle`
MFA. The hash on a finding must be traceable to an active `PolicyBundle` row
— that is the audit trail.

## Rules

1. **Only bundles evaluate.** `RuleSetRevision` rows hold `rules_json`, but
   nothing evaluates a revision directly: the lifecycle is draft → validate →
   approve → activate (only `:active` revisions participate in compilation),
   then `compile_policy_bundle` → `activate_policy_bundle`. Activation is
   validate-before-activate — the stored JSON must pass `AshRules.Ir.decode/1`
   in full before it can go live. Revisions are immutable: every save drafts
   a *new* revision; nothing already live is ever overwritten.
   `RuleSetRevision` is a temporal resource: each lifecycle update splits its
   period, so an `as_of:` read answers which status held at T. `activate`
   takes an optional `effective_at` argument to future-date the activation.
   Two revisions of the same `(organization_id, name)` cannot be active at
   overlapping instants — the database rejects the second activation; retire
   the old one first. (Global revisions with `organization_id: nil` are not
   covered by that constraint.) `TenantPolicySet` is period-versioned the same
   way: `set_revisions` and `set_active_bundle` split its period, and
   `tenant_policy_set(org_id, as_of: t)` returns the set that held at `t`.
   The compile itself reads the current set.
2. **The precedence is declared, never improvised.** A layering scheme is a
   module implementing `AshCompliance.Layering`: ordered layers (outermost
   first), each layer's permitted operations and their reach (`add`,
   `tighten`, `exclude`, `refine`, `waive`, `replace`, `parameterize`),
   protected operations, an optional required `scope_key`, and the
   precedence semantics. It is passed explicitly to
   `AshCompliance.Compiler.compile(scheme: ...)` or
   `AshCompliance.Compiler.resolve/3` — there is no application-env switch,
   because one host may run several schemes. With no `:scheme` the compiler
   uses `AshCompliance.Layering.Default`, the six ranks, lower rank winning on
   conflict: `:global_non_waivable` > `:global_mandatory` >
   `:profile_refinement` > `:tenant_strengthening` > `:approved_override` >
   `:tenant_supplement` (`AshCompliance.Compiler.Layer` answers from it).
   There, non-waivable global rules cannot be waived or replaced by anything;
   a waiver may target any other layer but rides at the override rank, so it
   never outranks its target; a replacement may only displace tenant
   supplements. Whatever the scheme, a `tighten` must be strictly stronger, a
   scoped contribution applies only where its scope matches the resolution
   context (so an inner removal never narrows an outer read), and the
   compiler refuses overreach rather than applying it. Do not add "just this
   once" layer jumps, caller-supplied orders, or inheritance shortcuts. If a
   layer's permissions are wrong for a program, change the design document
   (`documentation/topics/layering-and-combining.md`) first and the scheme
   second — a new scheme module for a new program, never an edit to
   `Layering.Default` that moves existing bundles.
3. **Waivers are bounded, approved and offset.** `expires_at`, `approver` and
   `compensating_controls` (at least one) are validation-enforced. Expiry is
   evaluated against the *compile clock*: an expired waiver is excluded from
   resolution entirely, so a waiver lapsing returns its rule to the effective
   bundle without any action being taken. That is a feature, not a bug to
   suppress. `PolicyOverride` is a temporal resource (period attribute
   `valid_at`): `starts_at` and `expires_at` are **create arguments** that set
   the period and read back only as calculations over it — there are no
   stored columns to write. A future `starts_at` future-dates the waiver
   (invisible to reads and compiles until that instant, no scheduler). The
   database rejects a second waiver whose window overlaps one already granted
   for the same organization, rule and subject scope (`WITHOUT OVERLAPS`);
   successive, non-overlapping windows are fine.
4. **The finding is the now, the evaluation is the decision.** `Finding` is a
   projection on the grain `[organization_id, control_id, subject_type,
   subject_id]`; `ComplianceEvaluation` is create-only — never updated,
   corrected or deleted. A wrong evaluation is superseded by the next one.
   Never mutate evaluation rows, never fold them into the projection, never
   skip recording one.
5. **Grain changes are migrations.** The finding grain is the identity of
   every projected row; changing it invalidates projections and histories.
   Bump the projector name (blue/green) instead of drifting the grain.
6. **Unknown never becomes compliant.** Do not feed placeholder facts to
   silence `:unknown` findings; fix the fact pipeline or the absence
   semantics. The property lives in `ash_rules` and this package preserves it
   end to end.
7. **Call through `AshCompliance.Domain`.** Every public action is a code
   interface there (`draft_rule_set_revision/2` ... `record_evaluation/2`,
   `active_policy_bundle/2`, the bundle compile/activate/retire lifecycle,
   the OSCAL reads) — hosts and this package's own internals call those,
   never raw `Ash.create!`/`Ash.Query` pipelines.
8. **No API layer.** The package ships resources, actions, the compiler, the
   projector and the editor. Do not add JSON:API/GraphQL surfaces here; the
   host owns exposure and its policies (the package ships no policy blocks,
   and `authorize?:`/`actor:` thread through every domain interface).

## Host wiring checklist

In order, before the first compile of a host that uses this package:

1. **Meet the floor.** PostgreSQL 18 with the `btree_gist` extension,
   `ash ~> 3.34` and `ash_postgres ~> 2.14`. `PolicyOverride`, `CatalogVersion`,
   `ControlRevision`, `RuleSetRevision`, `ProfileRevision` and
   `TenantPolicySet` are temporal resources: the `temporal` DSL needs those
   Ash versions, and their keys and identities become `WITHOUT OVERLAPS`
   constraints, which need PostgreSQL 18 and `btree_gist`. Declare
   `min_pg_version` 18 and `btree_gist` in the host repo's
   `installed_extensions` (the test repo, `test/support/test_repo.ex`, shows
   both).
2. **Set the repo in `config/config.exs` — before deps compile.** Resources
   bind `@repo Application.compile_env(:ash_compliance, :repo,
   AshCompliance.TestRepo)` at *compile time*
   (`lib/ash_compliance/resource.ex`; `Finding` repeats it). The default is a
   test-only module: build without the config and every resource silently
   compiles bound to `AshCompliance.TestRepo`, which does not exist in your
   release. `table_prefix` resolves the same way (default
   `"ash_compliance_"`). A runtime `AshCompliance.repo/0` also exists, but
   the compile-time binding is the one that bites.
3. **Register the domain.** Add `AshCompliance.Domain` to the host's
   `ash_domains` (or expose the same code interfaces from a host domain).
4. **Port the migrations.** The suite's `priv/test_repo/migrations` is the
   reference schema for the `ash_compliance_*` tables (plus the projector
   engine's tables); generate or port them into the host's migrations.
5. **No organizations? Use the single-org constant.** Tenancy here is an
   explicit `organization_id` attribute on every row — deliberately not Ash
   multitenancy, so shared catalogs (`organization_id: nil`) stay joinable.
   Org-less hosts mirror the clinic-demo pattern: a module attribute UUID and
   `def organization_id, do: @org`, passed everywhere.
6. **The guard path is sync-only.** Reading the active bundle and evaluating
   it needs no Oban, no projector, no supervisor. Oban is a dev/test-only dep
   here. Add `AshEvents.Projections.Supervisor` to the tree and register a
   projector only when you want findings projected from an event log; test
   the projector synchronously with `AshCompliance.Testing.drain_sync/3`
   (it folds events inside the caller's transaction, outside the async
   Server).

## The guard pattern

Same shape as the `ash_rules` guard pattern (build facts about the
transition, decode the *activated* bundle, evaluate, block on
`[:noncompliant, :unknown, :error]`, inert when no bundle is active, fail
closed when one cannot be evaluated) plus this package's audit half: on a
pass, `record_evaluation/2` runs **after the transaction, best-effort** — a
failed audit row is a logged warning, never a veto of a transition that
legitimately passed. Reference implementation:
`ClinicDemo.Scheduling.Changes.ComplianceGuard` in the clinic-demo host.

To *show* status instead of enforcing it, call
`AshCompliance.status_for(record, organization: ..., fact_builder: ...)`. It
runs the same evaluation against the active bundle and writes nothing (no
audit row). It returns `{:ok, %AshCompliance.Status{}}` with an overall
`status`, one `AshCompliance.Status.Verdict` per rule (`rule_id`, `severity`,
`gap`, `status`, `message`), the bundle hash and revision, and the missing
facts; `AshCompliance.Status.message/1` renders the guard's refusal text. No
active bundle is `{:error, :no_active_bundle}`, not compliance. Facts come
from the host through the `AshCompliance.FactBuilder` behaviour (a module, a
`{module, function}` pair, a capture, or the record's own module when it
implements the behaviour); `:facts` passes triples directly. Options other
than `:organization`, `:bundle`, `:facts` and `:fact_builder` reach the
builder, so the guard's `transition_to` works the same way here.

## RulesetEditorLive

`use AshCompliance.Web.RulesetEditorLive, domain: ..., organization: ...,
actor: ...` mounts the operator editor: `:domain` is required;
`:organization` is an MFA or literal (a route `:organization_id`/`:org` param
wins; neither raises at mount); `:actor` is an optional MFA threaded through
with `authorize?: true`. The editor edits **structured facts and rules** —
rows for {name, type, one_of, missing semantics} and {name, id, severity,
when_requires/fails_when triples, outcome, gap}, `$name` for a variable —
serialized through `AshRules.Ir.encode!` on save. There is no raw-DSL text
field: what the operator cannot say in the form, the engine cannot be handed.
The toolbar is the lifecycle 1:1 — Draft → Validate → Approve → Activate →
Compile bundle → Activate bundle — each button a thin form over the domain's
own code interface (all hidden forms, so tests drive the whole lifecycle
with `render_submit/2`, no browser). Validate renders the verifier's
diagnostics inline; a rule set that does not verify stays draft.

## Agent integration

`ash_agent_tools` has **no compliance-specific tool**: its optional
integrations are `:ash_rules` (the rules dry-evaluation tool),
`:ash_state_machine` (the transitions tool), `:ash_bpmn` (the process tools)
and `:ash_decisions` (the DMN decision tools) — check
`AshAgentTools.availability/0` for what is active in a given host. This
package's resources are ordinary Ash resources, so agents reach them with
the generic tools: `describe_resource`/`describe_action` for the action
contracts, `semantic_search/2` and `context/3` to find and edit them, and
the `ash_rules` tool to dry-evaluate a bundle before proposing a revision.
(Note for agents: the DSL-level rule set a host edits *in the editor* is
data — propose changes as new revisions through the domain interfaces, never
by rewriting `rules_json` in place.)

## Pin note

Not on Hex. GitHub dependency, and the repository is private:

```elixir
{:ash_compliance, github: "lukegalea/ash_compliance"}
```

`ash_rules` (itself a private GitHub dep) arrives transitively — one PAT
covers both, but CI needs the git rewrite configured before `mix deps.get`
(see this repo's workflow's "Give mix access to private git deps" step).
